I am a PhD Student in Applied Microeconomics at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, CA. I have spent the last year researching prosecutors, and I spent the summer as a graduate research assistant at UVA's Biocomplexity Institute doing work that focused on public good. I worked on creating actionable healthcare insights for a rural county in Virginia and researching the use of natural language processing with textual data from World War II. I am deeply interested in turning my focus on congressional success and elected officials' effects on communties. I intend to graduate with my PhD in the spring of 2023.
