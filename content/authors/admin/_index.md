I am a PhD Student in Applied Microeconomics at Claremont Graduate University in Claremont, CA. I have spent the last year researching prosecutors, and I spent the last two summers as a graduate research assistant at UVA's Biocomplexity Institute within the Social and Decision Analytics Division doing work that focused on public good. I worked on creating actionable healthcare insights for a rural county in Virginia, researched the use of natural language processing with textual data from World War II, compiled a resource of skills acquired by Army Officers in conjunction with the Army Research Institute, and measured racial equity in park access in Arlington County, Virginia. I am deeply interested in turning my focus on the intersection of divorce and crime. I intend to graduate with my PhD in the spring of 2022.
